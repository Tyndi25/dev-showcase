<h1>Who is Daniel Vincent?</h1>

<br>

I am a 28 year old geek, father, husband and amatuer hockey official who works as a software engineer during the week. I have been exposed to many different technologies during my short career in the software world. Technologies such as:
  
  * C++
  * C#
  * MSSQL
  * MySQL
  * Java
  * ASP.NET
  * Visual C++
  * Javascript (And its many flavors)
    1. React
    2. Meteor
    3. GraphQL
  * MongoDB
  * DynamoDB
  * Amazon Web Services

These are just a few of the technologies I have worked with over the years. I have been working with Javascript/ReactJS and various AWS tools the most over the past two years. But I have been attempting to make time to learn and experiment with other similar and vastly different technologies while at home.
